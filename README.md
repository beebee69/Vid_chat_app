Vid_chat_app
============


This is a simple real-time chat application with video and audio streaming. I'm using this to learn to use the WebRTC API. The architecture for the chat application will utilize the following things:

A Socket.io signalling server that resides on a Node.js platform.
A Heroku dyno that hosts the server application.
A browser client application that is hosted on Github Pages
To get the application up and running, you have to do the following:

Clone the repo
Install NodeJS
Install Grunt
Installing NodeJS

You can get a cop of NodeJS on its site here and install it. After installing it you will want to install grunt from the command line.

Now you can install Grunt's command line tools by typing out the following:

npm install -g grunt-cli
